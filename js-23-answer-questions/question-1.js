/*
  todo1: what is the difference between an asynchronous function and a synchronous function?
*/

// ! Answer
//Synchronous javascript means that the JavaScript engine executes our program sequentially, one line at a time from top to bottom in the exact order of the statements but in the asynchronous javascriopt is a technique that enables your program to start a potentially long-running task and still be able to be responsive to other events while that task runs, rather than having to wait until that task has finished. Once that task has finished, your program is presented with the result.

// *Asynchronous is a non-blocking architecture, which means it doesnâ€™t block further execution while one or more operations are in progress. With async programming, multiple related operations can run concurrently without waiting for other tasks to complete.
